<p>"Evolutionary Music" is a branch of Evolutionary Art, which means that the art itself is created based on an algorithm or number of rules.
In this WebPage, the music you hear is being created according to Cellular Automatas rules. The note that is being played (and its neighbours) will determine which notes are played in the next state.
Have Fun!</p>
